homebrew-term24
===============

Brew taps adding 24-bit true color terminal support.

Insalling homebrew-term24 formulae
----------------------------------

To install the tap use `brew tap choppsv1/term24` and then `brew install
<formula>`.

Most if not all the formulae in this tap will conflict with the
homebrew/homebrew versions so the actual command you will likely use is:
`brew install choppsv1/term24/<formula>`.
